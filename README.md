This version is coded in Python.

## 1. Exploratory Analysis
Examined correlations between Assortment, Promotions, Holiday effects, Competition, and core time-series components.
Selected features based on _correlation_ strength.
Limited the training set to the 80th- 100th sales percentile to reduce the influence of extreme values.

## 2. Pre-processing
Scaled numeric features with _MaxAbsScaler_ to retain sparsity while controlling magnitude.
Added _Ridge_ regularisation to mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting.

## 3. Models Evaluated
| Model                       |  Train RÂ² |  Test RÂ²  |
| --------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| Linear Regression           | **0.714** | **0.711** |
| Decision-Tree Regressor     | **0.999** | **0.847** |
| **Random-Forest Regressor** | **0.988** | **0.915** |

Random Forest offered the best biasâ€“variance trade-off and is the recommended model for this version.

# The refined version

Please check the refined version [here](https://github.com/LcLnAinIng/Rossmann-Forecasting-Sales/blob/LcLnAinIng-refined-R-v1/Refined%20Rossmann%20Sales%20Forecasting.qmd). (It is still very messy. I will organise it once it is done.)

> Goal â€“ Re-implement the project in R (fpp3 ecosystem) and build store-level forecasts with ARIMA and Dynamic Harmonic Regression (DHR), validated by store-wise cross-validation.

This project follows the methodology in [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/dynamic.html).

## Preperation Steps
- Feature simplification
  - Converted Promotion- and Competition-related variables to binary flags (0 / 1) after confirming this retained the relevant signal while reducing model complexity.

* Handling closed days
 - Observed that stores are closed on Sundays; whenever Open == 0, set Sales = 0.

- Time-series exploration
  - Applied STL decomposition and uncovered two strong seasonal patterns:
    - Annual seasonality.
    - Weekly seasonality.
  - Noted clear holiday effects (e.g., Christmas).

- Variance stabilisation & diagnostics
  - Performed a _Boxâ€“Cox transformation_ to flatten the data.
  - Ran _Ljung-Box_ and _unit-root tests_ to check white-noise behaviour and the need for ordinary/seasonal differencing.
  - Inspected _ACF_ plotsâ€”significant spikes violate the 1-in-20 rule, confirming seasonal structure.


 ## Modelling Workflow
 - Model-tuning store
   - Selected one representative store to experiment with parameter choices before scaling up to all stores.

 - Baseline ARIMA
  - Fitted an ARIMA to the Box-Cox-transformed series. Achieved ***<ins> AIC = 7273.14 </ins>***
    
- Dynamic Harmonic Regression (DHR)
  - in order to obtain a more sophisticated model, DHR is applied
  - Added 2 Fourier Terms to capture the seasonal cycles:
    ```{r}
    ARIMA(box_cox(Sales, Î») ~
      fourier("year",  K = 9) +   # yearly seasonality
      fourier("week",  K = 3))    # weekly seasonality
    ```
  - AIC dropped to 5334, a ***26.6% improvement*** over the plain ARIMA
  - Omitted trend() because the underlying trend is non-linear.
  - Attempts to introduce additional regressors (Promotion, Competition, etc.) unexpectedly produced null models and are under investigation. ðŸ« 
  - Only a DHR with Customers and StateHolidays could output a valid model

- Two-phase "gateway" logic
     1.  if `Open == 0` => predict `Sales == 0` ;
     2.  else => apply the DHR model


## Cross-Validation 
- Fold definition - one fold per store
- Objective - ensure forecasting performance is robust across the diverse Rossmann store network
- To save Computation power, 5 stores are chosen to represent all the stores and train the model
  - Those are the stores at the min, 25th quantile, 50th quantile, 75th quantile, max


## Model Performance - with Label Encoding
| Model                                                              |    AIC     |   RMSE    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------:  | :-------: |
| **STL + ETS**                                                      | **15411**  | **1412**  |
| **ARIMA**                                                          |  **7273**  | **5359**  |
| **DHR + 2 Fourier**                                                |  **5334**  | **1418**  |
| **DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features**                                   |  **3742**  |  **891**  |
| **DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features + Piecewise Trend**                 |  **3649**  |  **758**  |
| **2-Phase DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features**                           |  **3740**  |  **796**  |
| **2-Phase DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features + Piecewise Trend**         |  **3648**  |  **763**  |
| **DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features - without Label Encoding**          |  **2373**  |     -     |

With unknown bugs, the forecast with `DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features - without Label Encoding` model is unsuccessful.

## Next Steps
To diagnose why DHR with exogenous regressors returns null fits (check data sparsity, factor levels, or optimisation constraints).
Forecasting with the `DHR + 2 Fourier + 2 Features â€” no Label Encoding` model fails because of unresolved bugs. Any warrior is welcome to be my guest.
A Neural Network may also be applied for forecasting
